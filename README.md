# This is a project to learn how to use Tailwind CSS

This is based on the YouTube video from Learn Tailwind CSS - Course for Beginners from FreeCodeCamp and @codewithguillaume 

In this project, we learn how to 
- use template CSS saved under Tailwind 
- tailwind css is added inline on the program interface
- add custom CSS styling that we want under tailwind.config to use custom styling
- Negative values can be added by adding negative sign before the class
